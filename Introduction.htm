  <h1>Welcome to Omar's Website</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Omar Shah and I am beginning my journey to become a Software Engineer. It is Monday, February 19th 2024, and I am on learning how to use HTML. I am 32 years old with a degree in Business from The Pennsylvania State University. I am married to my beautiful wife, Sana Shah, who is supporting me along this journey. I have always had an interest in computers and programming, but was too scared to dive into this field. I have taken a few courses around programming, but the curriculum seemed difficult and my professor at the time did not seem helpful when I asked questions.

  <h2>Goals and Ambitions</h2>
  <p>Currently, I work for a civil engineering consulting firm. I manage and oversee all contracts for each of the project managers, ensuring that the project is within scope, time, and budget. Though I do love my job, I just see no more room for growth. I would be lying if I said money is not a motivator for me. It is a huge motivation for me. I would love to see myself grow and continuously learn and contribute more than I was able to a month ago. However, I just don't feel that way at my current job. It feels more like they want to keep me exactly where I am at for the next 5 years.</p>

  <h2>How Will I Achieve My Goals?</h2>
  <p>I have started this journey before, but ended up pausing it. This time I will adhere to a strict schedule, giving myself at least 1-2 hours a day to learn and move forward. After I complete each section (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), I want to create projects to showcase my learning abilities. This will help me see how far along I have come from where I started.</p>
